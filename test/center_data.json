The program will have three major goals: (i) to create research programs focused on the biological underpinnings of healthy central nervous system function as well as dysfunctions associated with the above disorders, (ii) to develop treatments for these disorders using new neuroscience tools, and (iii) to establish a rich neuroscience resource in New Jersey that educates the public, clinicians, faculty, and students, as well as state, national, and international health officials. The ultimate goal is to identify the biological bases of nervous system function and dysfunction, and apply new neuroscience techniques to develop powerful, effective strategies for prevention and treatment of brain and spinal disorders.",

By combining the substantial level of expertise in particle technology, optimization, multi-scale simulation, catalysis and molecular modeling available at Rutgers, we intend to develop and promote science-based methods for designing and optimizing catalyst manufacturing methods and processes such as impregnation, drying, slurry mixing, extrusion, calcination, etc. This will be integrated with a number of educational activities including research training of undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in the area of Catalyst Manufacturing.",

Alongside its main seminar, the CCA supports a series of working groups formed to explore an emerging area of inquiry, and it sponsors public events on problems of general interest that reach across several disciplines. Within Rutgers, the CCA acts as a central interdepartmental hub for collaboration; through the Aresty Fellows Program, it sponsors research opportunities for advanced undergraduates who are interested in creative approaches to interdisciplinary problems. As a member of the Consortium of Humanities Centers and Institutes (CHCI), the CCA is a primary site at the university for international partnerships and multi-institutional projects, enhancing Rutgers\u0027 global reputation as a top-tier research university.",

The RCHA\u0027s programs are designed to meet at least two needs: To put current social trends and issues in historical perspective and to overcome the fragmentation of knowledge which keeps us from seeing the wider dimensions of problems. The RCHA thus joins the scholarly concerns of an advanced research institute with the outreach programs of a major public educational institution. In addition to weekly seminars on Tuesdays, the Center hosts a variety of public conferences and related cultural events, sponsors an Institute for High School Teachers, and houses the Journal of the History of Ideas",

The i3D brings together a critical mass of NIH-funded basic and clinical research faculty with the goal of developing collaborative projects and multi-investigator translational research grants. Our goal is to house many of these faculty in one single building creating a platform for organic collaborations and resource sharing like never before. Based in Newark, a focus of the i3D will include global pathogens and diseases of the underserved. The emphasis on inflammation will provide novel insights into a range of diseases from Lyme disease to Tuberculosis.",

Researchers in the center also study fundamental, surface science and theoretical aspects of catalysts and catalysis and investigations of their structures and their structure-activity relationships. The center catalyzes mutual interactions and inter-disciplinary collaborations among many researchers around Rutgers as well as other nearby institutions such as the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT). RCRC also actively cooperates and forms partnerships with local catalysis societies such as the Catalysis Society Of Metropolitan New York, which is a local chapter of the NACS (North American Catalysis Society) serving the central New Jersey area and the rich catalysis intensive chemical industries around New Jersey.",

Our comprehensive imaging modalities for the basic sciences include: MRI, PET/CT, MicroCT, NanoCT, Optical/X-ray Imaging and High-Resolution Ultrasound technologies. The facility allows researchers to generate multiple, spatially-resolved anatomical, functional, and molecular-level readouts from a single study. Image reconstruction, quantitative image analysis, 3D display and printing are also available. The Center provides animal holding facilities for serial imaging, anesthesia, surgery and veterinary care. In addition to consultation and experimental services, the Center offers periodic training and conducts research to improve existing imaging technologies. Our mission is to empower Rutgers researchers by promoting independent utilization of the facility and to provide imaging resources to other organizations. Visit us at imaging.rutgers.edu",
